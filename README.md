# Auden Technical Test
 
## Explanation about Solution

I have completed this using Selenium WebDriver in C# and Specflow BDD framework

### Tools Used

C# - This is the OOP language that is currently used in the company  

Selenuim WebDriver - is a useful and one of the most popular tool for cross brower testing. It also drives a browser native as a user would which makes it a good choice for the web application being tested 

Specflow - was used to write the feature in a BDD format which is enables collaboration between technical and non-technical parties in the business because of the conversational style

Page Object Model - This is useful as it makes the codes reusable and easily maintained
